                       <p>
I'm pastelhex, a front-end web developer.</p>

<p>I currently attend university full-time where I study information technology. My main career interest is web design and front-end development, but game development also interests me.</p>

<p>Some of the technologies I have used in projects are Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, APIs, and Wordpress, and I also love making graphics and illustrations. Other languages I've used are Java, C# in Unity, and Visual Basic. Currently I am interested in Wordpress theme development and am working on my blog and social media presence. I am also working on some indie games.</p>

<p>When not coding, I am either watching dramas or anime, playing video games, writing, or posting my artwork online. As a completionist, I love checking off every little thing that has to be done. I have a family of parrotlets which I love dearly.</p>

<p>I am currently looking for an internship in web development, design, video games, or another IT position.
