# mid-2018
This was my fourth portfolio website I used from 2018 to 2019.

<p>For this one, I wanted to go as simple as possible and once again used my graphics to preview my projects, a dropdown button for the mobile navigation, and Jekyll. I also learned how to make custom tooltips and a cute <a href="https://codepen.io/P1N2O/pen/pyBNzX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CSS gradient animation</a> for the special link to my blog. Instead of using a white theme, I went for a kickass dark theme because I find it to be much easier on the eyes. Here is also where I changed my logo colors from blue and gold to blue-violet and turquoise.</p>

<p>Here's the mobile site in action:</p>
